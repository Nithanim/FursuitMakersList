# Fursuit makers list
This is a fairly recent list of fursuit makers. Collected roughly since 2024-10-01. ([Jump to lists](#lists))

Basic requirement for inclusion is having recent signs of life (like reachable website, posted pictures, ...) and also a somewhat easy findable statement of prices, terms of service and showcase of fursuits.

> [!WARNING]
> This is just a collection of makers, no recommendation! Always inform yourself thoroughly before commissioning! Also check the terms of services for legal conformity - know the law of your/their country!

> [!NOTE]
> There are makers in the list that have been grandfathered in although they do not qualify (e.g. missing info) to be included.

> I am unable to check every maker periodically, so it would be great if you could point out issues!

**To all makers**: make it easy and quick to find your offerings (partial or full, foam or TPU, ...), prices, terms of service, commission queue and country!
It is shitty having to sift through hundreds of messages to (hopefully) find (and deduce) this stuff - multiplied for *every* maker! At least pin an info post in your TG channel. Thank you!
