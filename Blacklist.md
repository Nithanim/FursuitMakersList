Not sure if I should even start such a list but as I stumbled upon this...

This list just points to discussions about certain makers.
This is in no way any proof of wrongdoings or illegal activity.
Likewise, a maker NOT on the list is NO guarantee of being free of wrongdoings or illegal acitvity.

ALWAYS INFORM YOURSELF!
